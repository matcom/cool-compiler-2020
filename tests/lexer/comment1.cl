        (* There was once a comment,
         that was quite long.
         But, the reader soon discovered that
         the comment was indeed longer than
         previously assumed. Now, the reader
         was in a real dilemma; is the comment
         ever gonna end? If I stop reading, will
         it end?
         He started imagining all sorts of things.
         He thought about heisenberg's cat and how
         how that relates to the end of the sentence.
         He thought to himself "I'm gonna stop reading".
         "If I keep reading this comment, I'm gonna know
         the fate of this sentence; That will be disastorous."
         He knew that such a comment was gonna extend to
         another file. It was too awesome to be contained in
         a single file. And he would have kept reading too...
         if only...
         cool wasn't a super-duper-fab-awesomest language;
         but cool is that language;
         "This comment shall go not cross this file" said cool.
         Alas! The reader could read no more.
